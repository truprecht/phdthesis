    \section{Implementation}
    This section gives a short overview of the software that implements the supertag extraction and parsing procedures that are described in the previous chapters.
    We developed the software over the course of multiple years, two iterations were already used in previous publictions for parsing with \abrv{lcfrs} supertags. \citep{RupMoe21,Rup22}
    While the first of these iterations was developed in colabouration with my colleague, all that came after that was my own work.
    The implementation provides the following modules and functionalities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item data structures for hybrid grammar and \abrv{dcp} supertags combined in a submodule called \texttt{grammar},
        \item procedures for the extraction of supertags from the common formats used to distribute discontinuous constituent treebanks, namely NeGra's \texttt{.export} format as well as TiGer's \texttt{.xml} format, in a submodule called \texttt{grammar.extraction},
        \item a polymorphic (i.e.\@ it is able to take on the shape of different architectures depending on the passed options) \abrv{ann} model used for a combined prediction of supertags and \abrv{pos} tags, as well as its training procedures in a submodule called \texttt{tagging}, 
        \item a unified parsing procedure for prediced supertags using the hybrid grammar and \abrv{dcp} formalisms in a submodule called \texttt{grammar.parsing},
        \item an extraction and parsing procedure using the discontinuous data oriented parsing approach used to rerank predicted constituent trees in a submodule called \texttt{grammar.dop},
        \item a subcommand \texttt{grid} that runs every combination in a set of specified options for the extraction and training procedures.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Most of the data structures and the extraction procedures are implemented in the Python programming language.
    We use the library provided by \texttt{disco-dop} \citep{Cra12} to read and preprocess treebanks, as well as the assessment of predicted constituent trees.
    \texttt{Pytorch} \citep{} and \texttt{flair} \citep{} provide the implementations used for the construction and training of the \abrv{ann} model.
    The module for the parsing procedure is compiled using \texttt{cython} \citep{} to enhance the parsing speed.
    In contrast to our earlier publications \citet{RupMoe21,Rup22}, the current version does not employ \texttt{disco-dop}'s parser for \abrv{lcfrs} anymore.
    We chose to replace it by an own implementation that is specialized to parsing with lexical instances of hybrid grammars and \abrv{dcp}.
    The implementation is publicly available\footnote{\url{asdafsfasf}} as \emph{free software} licensed under GPLv2.
