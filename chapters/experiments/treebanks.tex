    \section{Data and Tasks}\label{sec:treebanks}
    In the experiments of this chapter, we use three treebanks commonly investigated in discontinuous constituent parsing.
    \abrv{Negra} \citep{Skut98} and \tiger{} \citep{Brants04} are German constituent treebanks treebanks, and \dptb{} is a conversion of the English Penn Treebank \citep{Marcus94} into a discontinuous constituent treebank in the same format as \negra{} published by \citet{EvaKal11}.
    For each treebank, we consider the task of constituent parsing, including \abrv{pos} tag prediction; the sets of constituent and \abrv{pos} symbols are defined by each data set.
    All three treebanks contain newspaper text sentences that were enhanced using constituent structures and \abrv{pos} tags.
    There are published splits for the three treebanks commonly used in discontinuous parsing; the split by \citet{DubKel03} is used for \negra{}, the split by \citet{Sed13} is used for  \tiger{}, and the split by \citet{collins-1996-new} for \dptb{}.
    \Cref{tbl:treebanks} gives a brief overview of the size of the treebanks, their sets of constituent and \abrv{pos} symbols, and their split portions.
    
    \Citet{Maier15} pointed out an issue with the annotation of two trees in the \tiger{} treebank.
    We followed their suggestion and skipped these trees in the test portion.
    \Citet{CoaCoh19} published a script for the \tiger{} treebank that automatically resolves this and even more issues in the annotation where some nodes were provided with multiple parents.\footnote{The script can be found in their repository: \url{https://github.com/mcoavoux/multilingual_disco_data}.}
