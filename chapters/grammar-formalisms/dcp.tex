    \section{Definite Clause Programs}\label{sec:grammar:dcp}
    \deflab{\dcp}[Definite clause programs] \defabrv{\dcp}{\abrv{dcp}} were introduced as a formalism to characterize the derivation trees in attribute grammars \citep{Der85}.
    In contrast to \abrv{lcfrs}, it is a formalism where each rule produces trees instead of plain strings.
    The most striking difference to the previous formalism, however, lies in the composition expressions contained in each rule:
    They not only allow substitution with parameters produced by successors in a derivation (first-order substitution), but each single parameter may also contain variables that are substituted in the same step (second-order substitution).
    This corresponds to the information flow from the bottom to the top in a derivation expressed by synthetic attributes (first-order substitution) and the flow from the top to the bottom in a derivation by inherent attributes (second-order substitution) in attribute grammars \citep[cf.\@][Section~1]{Der88}.
    In the implementation of these two systems of substitution, two pairwise distinct sets of variables are used: \(\X\) for the first-order (as in \abrv{lcfrs}), and \(\Y\) for the second-order substitution.

    In their most general form, the object produced by a derivation in such a \abrv{dcp} is not necessarily computable, as the two types of substitution may mutually recur.
    Some restricted forms that exclude circular dependencies in the expressed productions were introduced to solve this issue \citep[Section~3.4 discusses non-circular attribute grammars]{Cou82}.
    It is easy to see that the definition shown in this section supersedes each of these restricted forms, as it exclusively allows fixed terminal objects or a single second-order variable as a parameter for second-order substitution.
    To avoid unnecessarily complicated definitions, the subset of \abrv{dcp} shown in this section is even further restricted:
    \begin{inparaenum}
        \item Each composition yields exactly one sequence of consecutive trees that is never separated.
        \item Each rule's composition expression allows exactly one second-order substitution (which may be the empty sequence). Thus, the symbol \(\y\) occurs exactly once in each composition.
    \end{inparaenum}
    We chose both restrictions to avoid having to distinguish successor derivations with special properties for the evaluation of the expressions.

    \begin{definition}[Composition]
        We fix the \(\DN\)-indexed family of finite sets of variable symbols \((\X_k = \{\x_i \mid i \in [k]\} \mid k \in \DN)\), and the singleton set \(\Y = \{\y\}\).
        The identifier \(\X\) denotes the set of the variable symbol \(\x\) with all subscripts \(\X = \{\x_i \mid i \in \DN\}\).
        Let \(\varSigma\) and \(\varGamma\) be alphabets such that both are disjoint from \(\X \cup \Y\).
        The \(\DN\)-indexed family \((S_k = \{x(v) \mid x \in \X_k, v \in \T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup Y)^*\} \mid k \in \DN)\) denotes substitution sites with variables up to subscript \(k\).
        The \(\DN\)-indexed family of \deflabs<composition>{\abrv{dcp} composition} over \(\varSigma\) and \(\varGamma\) is \((\C^{\varGamma\varSigma}_k \mid k \in \DN)\) such that \(\C^{\varGamma\varSigma}_k\) contains each nonempty sequence \(c\) in \((\T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup \Y \cup S_k))^+\) such that each variable in \(\X_k \cup \Y\) occurs exactly once in \(c\).
        The identifier \(\C^{\varGamma\varSigma}\) denotes the set of all \abrv{dcp} compositions \(\bigcup_{k \in \DN} \C^{\varGamma\varSigma}_{k}\).
        We usually abbreviate compositions with a trailing occurrence of the variable \(\y\) by omitting it, and each substitution site of the form \(x(\varepsilon)\) by \(x\) and omitting the empty argument with the wrapping parentheses, as long as it improves the readability.

        Each composition \(c \in \C^{\varGamma\varSigma}_k\) is associated with a function \[
            \sem{c}\colon \big(\T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup Y)^*\big)^k \to \T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup Y)^*
        \] that is defined as follows:
            Let \((\x_i(w_i) \in S_k \mid i \in [k])\) be the family of substitution sites occurring in \(c\) and \((v_i \in \T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup Y)^* \mid i \in [k])\) a family of arguments.
            Then \(\sem{c}\) is defined as a second-order substitution of \(\X_k\) in \(c\) such that \(\sem{c}(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_k) = c\big[\x_1(w_1)=\xi_1[\y=w_1], \ldots, \x_k(w_k)=\xi_k[\y=w_k]\big]\).
    \end{definition}

    %    The occurrences of variables are abbreviated in the following two ways:
    %    \begin{compactenum}
        %        \item Variables in \(\X\) with successor \(\varepsilon\) are abbreviated by omitting the parentheses and the successor as a whole; e.g.\@ instead of \(\x_1(\varepsilon)\), we just write \(\x_1\).
        %        \item We omit trailing occurrences of the variable \(\y\) if it does not occur as a successor of any node; e.g.\@ instead of \(\text{S}(\x_1)\,\y \), we just write \(\text{S}(\x_1)\).
        %    \end{compactenum}

    \begin{example}\label{ex:dcp:comp}\NoEndMark
        Consider the following six \abrv{dcp} compositions over the two alphabets \(\varGamma = \{ \cn{sbar}, \cn{s}, \cn{vp}, \cn{np} \}\) and \(\varSigma = \{\tn{where}, \tn{the}, \tn{survey}, \tn{was}, \tn{carried}, \tn{out}\}\):
        \begin{align*}
            c_1 &= \tn{where} \, \y,
            &c_2 &= \y \; \tn{out},
            &c_3 &= \cn{np} (\y \; \tn{survey}) && \in \C^{\varGamma \varSigma}_0 \text{,}\\
            c_4 &= \cn{vp}(\x_1(\y) \, \tn{was}) && && && \in \C^{\varGamma \varSigma}_1 \text{,} \\
            c_5 &= \cn{sbar} (\cn{s} (\x_1(\y) \, \x_2(\tn{the}))),
            &c_6 &= \cn{vp}(\x_1(\y) \, \x_2(\tn{carried})) && && \in \C^{\varGamma \varSigma}_2 \text{.}
        \end{align*}
        The subscript \(i\) in the family of \abrv{dcp} compositions \(\C^{\varGamma\varSigma}_i\) determines the number of arguments for the functions represented by the elements in \(\C\).
        For instance, \(\sem{c_1}\) takes no arguments, and \(\sem{c_6}\) takes two arguments.
        Evaluating any term of these compositions yields a sequence of trees in \(\T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup \Y)^*\) with exactly one occurrence of \(\y\), for example:
        \begin{align*}
            \sem{c_6} \big( \sem{c_1}(), \sem{c_2}() \big)
            &= \sem{c_6} \big( \: (\tn{where} \, \y), \: (\y \, \tn{out}) \: \big) \\
            &= \cn{vp}(\x_1(\y) \, \x_2(\tn{carried}))[\x_1(\y)=(\tn{where} \, \y), \x_2(\tn{carried})=(\tn{carried}\, \tn{out})] \\
            &= \cn{vp}(\tn{where} \, \y \; \tn{carried out}) \text{.}
        \end{align*}

        Consider the two compositions \(c_7 = (\cn{vp}(\x_1(\varepsilon) \, \x_2(\tn{carried}))\,\y)\) and \(c_8 = (\cn{vp}(\x_1(\varepsilon) \, \tn{was})\,\y)\), and the term \(\sem{c_8}\big( \sem{c_7}\big(\sem{c_1}(), \sem{c_2}()\big) \big)\) that is evaluated as follows:
        \begin{align*}
            \sem{c_8}\big( \sem{c_7}\big(\sem{c_1}(), \sem{c_2}()\big) \big)
            &= \sem{c_8}\big( \sem{c_7}\big((\tn{where} \; \y), (\y \; \tn{out})\big) \big)\\
            &= \sem{c_8}\big( (\cn{vp}(\tn{where} \; \tn{carried} \; \tn{out} )\,\y)  \big)\\
            &= \cn{vp} (\cn{vp}(\tn{where} \; \tn{carried} \;\tn{out} )\, \tn{was})\,\y\text{.}
        \end{align*}
        The occurrences of the variable symbol \(\y\) in the compositions \(c_1\) and \(c_7\) are replaced by \(\varepsilon\), they are essentially removed and do not play any role in the result.
        In such situations, we abbreviate the compositions by omitting the trailing occurrences of $\y$ as well as the argument \((\varepsilon)\) at the substitution sites; we just denote \(c_1 = \tn{where}\), \(c_7 = \cn{vp}(\x_1 \, \x_2(\tn{carried}))\) and \(c_8 = \cn{vp}(\x_1\, \tn{was})\,\y\).
        \\\null\hfill\exampleqed
    \end{example}

    When we assume the above form of compositions, \abrv{dcp} grammars, \deflab<derivation>{\abrv{dcp} derivation}[derivations], and most of the concepts of rule and grammar forms are defined analogously to \abrv{lcfrs}; we will refrain from repeating these definitions completely but focus on the differences.
    As we have seen, \abrv{dcp} compositions contain elements from two alphabets, \(\varGamma\) for inner nodes (which we assume to be constituent symbols) and  \(\varSigma\) for leaf nodes (tokens or sentence positions, respectively), only the symbols in \(\varSigma\) are considered lexical symbols.
    The tuple for a \abrv{dcp} grammar is extended by the additional alphabet; it is of the form \((N, \varGamma, \varSigma, S, R)\).
    There is no fanout in \abrv{dcp} because the sequences of trees produced by the above compositions are not meant to be separated.
    To avoid that a derivation for an initial nonterminal produces more than one tree, we require that the composition in each rule of rank \(k>0\) whose \abrv{lhs} nonterminal is in \(S\) is either of the form \(\gamma( \omega) \y\) or \(\gamma(\omega)\) for some \(\gamma \in \varGamma\) and \(\omega \in \T_\varGamma(\varSigma \cup S_k)^+\); that is, there is at least one inner node that assembles the results of all successor rules.
    As in other grammar formalisms, the yield for a derivation computes the composition functions recursively.
    This recursive evaluation will leave exactly one superfluous variable symbol \(\y\) that originates from the root's composition; it is removed from the result.
    In contrast to string grammars, like \abrv{lcfrs}, the \deflab<yield>{yield of a \abrv{dcp} derivation}[yield] of a complete derivation is a tree in \(\T_\varGamma(\varSigma)\).

    As \abrv{lcfrs}, we deal with \abrv{dcp} grammars that are instantiated with sentence positions as lexical symbols during the rule extraction as well as parsing.
    An instantiated \abrv{dcp} grammar for a sequence of length \(n\) is of the form \((N, \varGamma, [n], S, R')\) and defined analogously to instantiated \abrv{lcfrs}.
    For any composition \(c \in \C^{\varGamma\,[n]}\) and any derivation \(d \in \derivs^{R'}\), let us denote the set of all lexical symbols within \(c\) by \(\mathrm{lex}(c)\) and all lexical symbols within \(d\) by \(\mathrm{lex}(d)\).
    We call a derivation \(d \in \derivs^{R'}\) of the form \(A \to c\,(B_1, \ldots, B_k) \big( d_1, \ldots, d_k \big)\) \deflab<admissible>{admissible \abrv{dcp} derivation}[admissible] if all its successors \(d_1, \ldots, d_k\) are admissible and all the following sets are mutually exclusive: \(\mathrm{lex}(c), \mathrm{lex}(d_1), \ldots, \mathrm{lex}(d_k)\); that is, no instantiated lexical symbol occurs twice.\footnote{
        Such ``unrestricted \abrv{dcp}'' showed to be infeasible for parsing during our experiments, so we equipped each rule with a fanout (which does not need to be consistent among all rules for a \abrv{lhs} nonterminal).
        This is discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:supertags,sec:parsing:dcp}.
    }
    The identifier \(\aderivs^{R'}\) denotes the set of admissible derivations in \(R'\).
    For each derivation \(d \in \aderivs^{R'}\), the \deflab{constituent structure for a \abrv{dcp} derivation}[constituent structure for \(d\)] is the yield of \(d\).
    For each set of derivations \(D \subseteq \derivs^{R'}\) of \abrv{dcp} rules, we define the \(N\)-indexed family \((D_A \subseteq D \mid A \in N)\) such that each derivation in \(D_A\) is rooted in a rule with the \abrv{lhs} nonterminal \(A\); and, for each \(\pi \subseteq [n]\), we denote the set of all derivations with the lexical symbols \(\pi\) by \(D(\pi) = \{d\in D \mid \mathrm{lex}(d) = \pi\}\).

    \begin{example}[Continues \cref{ex:dcp:comp}]\NoEndMark
        Consider a \abrv{dcp} \((N, \varGamma, [|w|], \nt{s}, R)\) that is a position instantiation for \(w = \text{``where the survey was carried out''}\), with \(N = \{\nt{v}^\nt{L}, \nt{v}, \nt{n}, \nt{s} \}\) and \(\varGamma = \{\cn{vp}, \cn{sbar}, \cn{s}, \cn{np}\}\), and
        \begin{align*}
            R = \Big\{ \quad
            \nt{v}^\nt{L} &\to (\tn{1} \, \y),
            \quad \nt{v} \to (\y \, \tn{6}),
            &\nt{n} &\to (\cn{np} (\y \, \tn{3})), \\
            \nt{v} &\to (\cn{vp}(\x_1(\y) \, \tn{4}))\:(\nt{v}),  \\
            \nt{s} &\to (\cn{sbar} (\cn{s} (\x_1(\y) \, \x_2(\tn{2}))))\:(\nt{v}, \nt{n}),
            &\nt{v} &\to (\cn{vp}(\x_1(\y) \, \x_2(\tn{5})))\:(\nt{v}^\nt{L}, \nt{v})
            \quad \Big\} \text{.}
        \end{align*}

        The tree \(d\) illustrated below (left) is a derivation in \(\derivs^R_\nt{s}\), its constituent structure \(\yield(d)\) is shown to the right.
        A part of the computations (for the bottom \(\cn{vp}\)-node) was already shown in the previous example in detail.

    The following definition is used for the extraction of \abrv{dcp} compositions from an indexed tree.
    It identifies a coherent set of positions in the input tree using a sequence of parallel (bottom) positions and a common ancestor.
    Each position is complemented with a set of leaves to accommodate missing elements that are represented by second-order substitution sites.

    \begin{definition}\label{def:dcp:comp}
        Consider an indexed tree \(\xi \in \itrees_{\varGamma}\) over any alphabet \(\varGamma\) together with
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                a collection of \(k \in \DN\) parallel positions \((\rho_i \in \pos(\xi) \mid i \in [k])\) and
                a common ancestor position \(\rho_0 \in \bigcap_{i \in [k]} \ancestors(\rho_i)\), as well as
            \item
                a non-empty set of leaves \((L_i \subseteq \yield(\xi|_{\rho_i}) \mid i \in [0, k])\) for each of the positions such that
                \(L_0\) subsumes all other sets: \(\bigcup_{i\in[k]} L_i \subseteq L_0\). Additionally, \(L_i\) must differ at most by one leaf from the set of leaves \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_i})\) for each \(i \in [0,k]\).
        \end{itemize}

        The \abrv{dcp} composition \(c \in \C^{\varGamma L_0}_k\) for \(\xi\) and \(((\rho_i, L_i) \mid i \in [0,k])\) is defined as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                The \([k]\)-indexed family of substitution site arguments \((\omega_i \in L_0 \cup \{\varepsilon\} \mid i \in [k])\) is defined such that, for each \(i\in[k]\), \(\omega_i = \varepsilon\) if \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_i}) = L_i\) and otherwise there is an \(\ell_i \in \yield(\xi|_{\rho_i})\) such that \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_i}) = L_i \cup \{\ell_i\}\) and \(\omega_i = \ell_i\).
            \item
                The composition \(c' \in \C^{\varGamma\,\yield(\xi|_{\rho_0})}_k\) is obtained from \(\xi|_{\rho_0}\) be replacing each subtree at position \(\rho_i\) with the substitution site \(\x_i(\omega_i)\) for each \(i \in [k]\).
            \item
                If \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_0}) = L_0\), then the composition is supplemented by the variable \(\y\) and \(c=c' \y\).
                Otherwise, there is a leaf \(\ell_0 \in \yield(\xi|_{\rho_0})\) such that \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_0}) = L_0 \cup \{\ell_0\}\) and then \(c\) is obtained from \(c'\) by replacing \(\ell_0\) with the variable\(\y\).
        \end{itemize}
        We denote this composition \(c\) by \(\mathrm{scomp}(\xi, (\rho_0, L_0), (\rho_1, L_1), \ldots, (\rho_k, L_k))\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}\NoEndMark
        Consider the indexed tree \(\xi\) below and the positions marked at its root \(\rho_0 = \varepsilon\) as well as its grandchildren \(\rho_1 = 1\,1\) and \(\rho_2=1\,2\).
        Moreover, consider the three sets of leaves \(L_0 = \yield(\xi) = [6]\), \(L_1 = \yield(\xi|_{\rho_1}) = \{1,4,5,6\}\) and \(L_2 = \{3\} = \yield(\xi|_{\rho_2}) \setminus \{2\}\); note that \(L_0 = L_1 \cup L_2 \cup \{2\}\).
        The composition \(\mathrm{scomp}(\xi, (\rho_0, L_0), (\rho_1, L_1), (\rho_2, L_2))\) is obtained as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  we define two arguments for second-order substitution, \(\omega_1 = \varepsilon\) since \(L_1 = \yield(\xi|_{\rho_1})\), and \(\omega_2 = 2\) since \(L_2 = \yield(\xi|_{\rho_2}) \setminus \{2\}\);
            \item \(c'\) consists of the nodes in \(\xi\) starting with the root \(\rho_0 = \varepsilon\) to the bottom up to the positions \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\) which are replaced by the variables \(\x_1\) and \(\x_2\) extended by the parameters \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\), it is \(c' = \cn{sbar}(\cn{s} (\x_1(\varepsilon), \x_2(2)))\),
            \item the composition \(c\) is \(c'\) extended by a trailing occurrence of the variable \(\y\), since \(L_0 = \yield(\xi_{\rho_0})\), hence \(\mathrm{scomp}(\xi, (\rho_0, L_0), (\rho_1, L_1), (\rho_2, L_2)) = \cn{sbar}(\cn{s} (\x_1(\varepsilon), \x_2(2))) \, \y\).

    \begin{lemma}
        Let \(\xi \in \itrees_{\varGamma}\), \(k \in \DN\) and \(((\rho_i, L_i) \in \pos(\xi) \times \power(\yield({\xi})) \mid i \in [0,k])\) be an indexed tree, positions and sets of leaves as specified in \cref{def:dcp:comp}.
        Moreover, let \((\xi_i' \in \T_\varGamma(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_i}) \cup \{\y\}) \mid i \in [0,k])\) be trees such that, for each \(i \in [0,k]\) the tree \(\xi_i'\) is obtained from \(\xi|_{\rho_i}\) as follows:
        \begin{compactitem}
            \item if \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_i}) \neq L_i\), then by replacing the leaf in \(\yield(\xi|_{\rho_i}) \setminus L_i\) with the variable \(\y\),
            \item otherwise by adding a trailing variable \(\y\) such that \(\xi_i' = \xi_{\rho_i}\,\y\).
        \end{compactitem}
        
        Then \(\sem{\mathrm{scomp}(\xi, (\rho_0, L_0), (\rho_1, L_1), \ldots, (\rho_k, L_k))}(\xi_1', \ldots, \xi_k') = \xi_0'\).
