    \chapter{Grammar Formalisms}\label{sec:grammars}
    This chapter describes three grammar formalisms that we use for parsing natural language sentences.
    For the subject of this thesis, let us consider a grammar as a collection of rules that are capable of deriving strings (or trees).
    All considered grammar formalisms share the same fundamental structure of their rules:
        Each rule contains a sequence of nonterminal symbols, one of which is called the left-hand side (\abrv{lhs}) nonterminal and the rest the right-hand side (\abrv{rhs}) nonterminals, and an expression that computes strings or trees based on an argument for each \abrv{rhs} nonterminal.
        All non-variable symbols occurring in these expressions are called terminal symbols.
    The nonterminals already hint at the recursive structure of grammar derivations: the arguments used to compute the result are computed by successor rules whose \abrv{lhs} nonterminal match the \abrv{rhs} nonterminals.

    Within the scope of this thesis, however, grammars are not used to compute strings, but the opposite:
        We analyze strings in consideration of which collection of grammar rules may be used to derive them; this is called \emph{parsing}.
    Typically, the result of this process is not a collection of grammar rules but a digest of it, called \emph{parse}, and resembles a constituent structure.
    Grammars for natural languages are usually highly ambiguous; that is, many combinations of rules can derive a given string.
    One approach to handle such ambiguities are weight assignments that rank parses and choose the supposed best among them.
    \emph{Weighted grammar formalisms} couple such assignments for each rule and operations to accumulate the assigned weights for each parse.
    These weight assignments per rule are usually integrated into parsing algorithms so that intermediate results already take them into account and rank them accordingly.
    In the literature, there is a lot of theoretical work about general frameworks for weight structures in parsing with grammars.
    For instance, \citet{Goodman} gives an overview of weighted parsing within the semiring framework.
    However, in practice, it often boils down to numerical values interpreted as probabilities or cumulative costs.
    We will focus on the latter one and equip grammar rules with real-valued scores.
    These values are added when considering a collection of rules deriving a parse and wrapped to the supremum value when considering multiple different collections of rules that derive the same parse.

    \Cref{sec:grammar:lcfrs} focuses on linear context-free rewriting systems (\abrv{lcfrs}), an extension of context-free grammars introduced by \citet{VijWeiJos87} and extensively studied by \citet{SekMatFujKas91}.
    In this formalism, each rule produces a tuple of strings which may occur in non-consecutive parts of a finally derived string.
    This is used to model sentence positions in the yield of discontinuous constituents.
    When \abrv{lcfrs} are used for parsing constituency structures, we typically find a rule derivation that computes the input sentence and assumes the nonterminals occurring in the derivation as constituency structure.

    Secondly, \cref{sec:grammar:dcp} aims at definite clause programs (\abrv{dcp}), which were introduced by \citet{Der85} as a logic characterization of attribute grammars.
    The formalism was used in the context of parsing by \citet{Ned14}, but exclusively in conjunction with \abrv{lcfrs} forming hybrid grammars.
    In contrast to context-free grammars and \abrv{lcfrs}, each rule in this grammar formalism computes a collection of trees instead of strings.
    Here, a subset of \abrv{dcp} is considered, whose rules may only produce consecutive parts in trees.
    Parsing with \abrv{dcp} finds a derivation that produces a tree with the input sentence in its leaves and assumes the tree as a constituency structure.

    Lastly, \cref{sec:grammar:hybrid} considers \abrv{lcfrs}/\abrv{dcp} hybrid grammars as introduced by \citet{Ned14} (see also \citealp{Geb17}; and \citealp{Geb20}).
    They combine the two aforementioned grammar formalisms:
        Besides the nonterminals, each rule contains the expression of an \abrv{lcfrs} as well as the expression of a \abrv{dcp}.
    During parsing, we find a derivation such that the \abrv{lcfrs} expressions produce the input sentence, and the \abrv{dcp} expressions yield the constituency structure.

    In the following sections for each of the three formalisms, the grammars are described gradually:
    \begin{inparaenum}
        \item Each section starts with the expressions contained in each rule that compose strings or trees.
        \item After that, each section expresses the rules and the other components in a grammar.
        \item Finally, the derivations in such a grammar are explained in tandem with their computed objects.
    \end{inparaenum}
    Each of these subsections is accompanied by examples that give intuitions for the described structures.
